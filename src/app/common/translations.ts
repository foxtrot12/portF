  aboutMe: `Hi, I'm Chinmaya a passionate web developer and tech enthusiast based in Gurgaon. With a degree in computer science from Amity School of Engineering and Technology, I excel in creating vibrant, accessible web designs.
As a Software Engineer at SHL India, I've worked on projects like the TC Plus assessments platform and avatar-based assessments. I'm proficient with Angular and React and adept at picking up new frameworks.
One highlight is developing a gamified process monitoring assessment, integrating advanced animations. For my work, I received the Experienced Practitioner award in October 2022.
I thrive both in teams and independently, mentoring junior members and continuously exploring new technologies to enhance user experiences. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
